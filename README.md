### Hi there 👋
My name is Satyanarayan Dalei. I am a junior full-stack developer. I am doing my Master's degree in Computer Application. I have completed my web development bootcamp from Udemy. Though I have worked on both frontend and backend technology, backend has been my core field of interest so far. I use MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js and Bootstrap for building full-stack projects. I am well familiar with the git version control system.

Speaking about my project experience:-
"Money expenditure tracker" is one of the best full-stack projects I have built during my learning period. It not only has CRUD operation but uses cookie-based authentication to authorize users. One of my recent Hackathon projects involved developing a web application using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I collaborated with a team of UI/UX designers, and frontend developers. We built a robust solution that helps people track their emotions and manage them.

Working effectively in teams is crucial, and I've had the opportunity to refine my collaboration skills during group projects. I believe that strong teamwork and clear communication are the keys to success in any software development endeavour.

I'm constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow. I participate in hackathon programs to expand my knowledge and work in a team. I'm thrilled about the possibility of joining your team and contributing to your exciting projects. I am super active on LinkedIn and Twitter. I can be reached right away at ✉️ satyaprofessional99@gmail.com. You can also visit my portfolio at 🌐https://satyadalei.github.io/portfolio/

Thank you for taking the time to watch my introduction. I look forward to the opportunity to work together!
